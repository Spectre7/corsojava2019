# Esercizio 1
Define a class called Fraction. This class is used to represent a ratio of two integers.
Include mutator functions that allow the user to set the numerator and the
denominator. Also include a member function that returns the value of numerator
or denominator as a double. Include an additional member function that
outputs the value of the fraction reduced to lowest terms (e.g., instead of outputting
20/60 the method should output 1/3). This will require finding the greatest
common divisor for the numerator and denominator, then dividing both by that
number. Embed your class in a test program.
